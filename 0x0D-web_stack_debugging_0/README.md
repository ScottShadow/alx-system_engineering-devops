Docker Apache HTTP Server Setup
This repository contains instructions for setting up an Apache HTTP Server using Docker.

Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure that you have Docker installed on your system. If not, you can download and install Docker from the official website: Docker Desktop

Steps

1. Pull the Apache Image
   Pull the official Apache HTTP Server image from Docker Hub by running the following command:

sudo docker pull httpd:latest 2. Run Apache Container
Run a Docker container based on the Apache image using the following command:

sudo docker run -p 8080:80 -d -it my-apache-image
This command starts a new Docker container named my-apache-container based on the Apache image. It maps port 8080 on the Docker host to port 80 in the container, allowing you to access the Apache web server on port 8080 from your host machine. The container is run in detached mode, meaning it runs in the background.

3. Access Apache Web Server
   After running the Docker container, access the Apache web server by navigating to http://localhost:8080 or using curl 0:8080 in your web browser on the Docker host machine. You should see the default Apache web page or any custom content you have configured.

Additional Notes
If you want to stop the Apache container, you can use the sudo docker stop my-apache-container command.
For more advanced configuration of Apache, you can mount custom configuration files or website files into the container using volume mounts.
